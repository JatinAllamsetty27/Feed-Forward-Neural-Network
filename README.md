# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network
This is a repository consisting of Easy implementation of Feed Forward Neural Networks 


Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) can be applied to a wide range of domains and tasks, including:
1.Image and pattern recognition: FFNNs can be used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.
2.Natural language processing: FFNNs are effective in tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and language translation.
3.Speech recognition: FFNNs can be employed in speech recognition systems to convert spoken language into written text.
4.Financial forecasting: FFNNs are utilized for predicting stock prices, market trends, and financial risk analysis.
5.Recommender systems: FFNNs play a significant role in personalized recommendations, such as movie or product recommendations based on user preferences.
6.Fraud detection: FFNNs are valuable in identifying fraudulent transactions and detecting anomalies in large datasets.
7.Medical diagnosis: FFNNs can aid in diagnosing diseases, interpreting medical images, and predicting patient outcomes based on medical data.
8.Time series analysis: FFNNs can analyze and forecast time-dependent data, such as weather patterns, stock market trends, or energy consumption.
9.Autonomous vehicles: FFNNs can contribute to tasks like object detection, lane recognition, and decision-making in self-driving cars.
10.Quality control: FFNNs can be employed in manufacturing processes to detect defects or anomalies in products.
These are just a few examples, showcasing the versatility and wide applicability of Feed Forward Neural Networks in various industries and problem domains.
